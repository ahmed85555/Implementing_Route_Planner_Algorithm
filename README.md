# Udacity_Implementing_Route_Planner_Algorithm

In this project you will use A* search to implement a "Google-maps" style route planning algorithm.
in this project you will find a helpers file and test file.
helpers file contains the representaion of the map nodes or intersections and the roads between them and some other additional funcitionalities that will help while Implementing the Algorithm.
